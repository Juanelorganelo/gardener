## WIP :warning:
This project is still a work-in-progress, there's little to no documentation and it hasn't even been released to NPM. Use it at your own risk.

## TODO
- [x] Use multiple presets
- [x] Make sure GitFlow preset can ensure `main` or `master` and `develop` exist.
- [x] Pass multiple branch information to presets so mandatory branches can be enforced.
